# Trivia-game
Trivia game, fetching questions from trivia-api using Python OOP, OOD want to try it yourself? :)

Few points I want to support in the future:\n
  *For now the game supports only single player mode but I would support in the future playing online using mobile app (sounds fun !).
  *Hopefully game login will be supported as well so I can track over player progress and scores in game.

Types of Questions:
  There are two types of questions in this game one is :
    1. True or false question
    2. Multiple question

Rules:
  *Questions will come out one at a time answering wrong will grant you 1 error point.
  *Once you have 3 errors the game is over, so think carefully before you answer.
  *At the end of each game your score will be printed so you can track your achievment each time.

*If you like this product please comment or contact me your support is much appreciated.
